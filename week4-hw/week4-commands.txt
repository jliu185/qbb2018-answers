# Notes from class
REVIEW OF WHAT WE DID LAST WEEK
	Sequencing data -> Aligned with reference sequence -> Variant calling -> Predicted effects
COMMON DISEASE-COMMON VARIANT HYPOTHESIS
	Multiple alleles that will contribute to a common disease
		variants have low penetrance
		Evolutionary neutral
	This week, instead of predicting theses effects, we will try to associate 	these variants with a disease 
WTCCC
	Look at 14k people (controls included), associate with 7 common diseases
ENCODING FOR VARIANT AND PHENOTYPE
	EXAMPLE
		Ref: A 
		Alt: T
		Variant: [genotype AA AT TT]
			     [          0  1  2]
				 [Allele    A   T  ]
		**Can use "cochran armitage" to look at genotype, needs to be a 3 by 2 		table**
		**2 x 2 table, can use a Chi squared statistical model**
		
		Phenotype: [Case control Y N]
		           [Quantitative    ]
		**Can use a regression + Wards test**
	Need to account for implicit variance in your sample when creating a p-value
MULTIPLE TESTING
	Need to alter your P-value
	FWER (Family wise error)
		alpha = 0.001
		m = # of tests 
		p = alpha / m (Bonferroni correction)
	False discovery rate 
		alpha = 0.001
		K = False discovery rate (%, chosen by you)
		Rank order P-values
			p < alpha * (K/m) (Benjamini-Hochberg)
	P < 5*10^-7
